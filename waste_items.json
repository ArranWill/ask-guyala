The 8% is a value that only accounts from the littering of food scraps by humans (Earth Org 2022). The littering of food scraps is causing the Australian economy a nearly $36.6 billion (Queensland Government 2022). With that the statistics suggest that It is also found out that a range in between $2000 and $2500 is spent on the wasted food by the Australian households each year (Queensland Government 2022)."
